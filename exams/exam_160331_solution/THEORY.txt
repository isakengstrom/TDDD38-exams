Question 1:
The function is parameterized on one type. Calling it with two different types will not work.
The task is to change the call (not any of the declarations) and there are thus two different
kind of solutions, explicitly converting one of the arguments or explicitly instantiate the
function for a specific type:

  max<double>(i,d);

  max(static_cast<double>(i), d);


Question 2:
An unnamed namespace is a namespace without a name (duh). Everything declared in an unnamed
namespace is automatically used directly after the namespace declaration (just like you hadn't
had the namespace). The great thing about unnamed namespaces is that they are local to that
specific file, i.e. the declarations cannot be accessed from outside the file.

Question 3:
There are two (and only two) places where mutable can be used according to the standard:

    1. When declaring a non-static, non-const, non-reference member to make it possible to
       change that member in a const expression such as from a const-declared member function
       or on a const object.

    2. Together with a lambda to be able to change the members of the created closure object: 
       [var]() mutable {++var;}


Question 4:
Let's say we have two types, T and U. The following example shows two examples of conversion, via a
type converting constructor (constructor taking ONE argument of the type we want to convert from) and a
type converting operator.

class T
{
    T(U) {...} // converting from U to T via a constructor
    operator U() {...} // conversion operator, from T to U


Question 5:
A delegating constructor is a constructor that calls another constructor for THE SAME class.
The call MUST be in the member initializer list.

class Foo
{
    Foo(int i, double d) : vi{i}, di{d} {}
    Foo(int i) : Foo{i,0.0} {} // delegating constructor call
}
