# TDDD38-exams
Previous exam files and solutions for the course [Advanced programming in C++ (TDDD38)](https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDD38/) at LiU.

The first exam is from March 2016 and the latest is from June 2021. 

The repo contains two folders:

- [exams_cmake](exams_cmake/) - Contains the given files and solutions to the exams of the course, with ready to use CMake configurations.
- [exams_raw](exams_raw/) - Just the files and solutions, no CMake BS

<br />

> **Note:** The C++ code and answers to exam questions in this repo does not belong to me in any way. The repo exists, simply to make the process of downloading previous exams easier for other students.

> **Node:** The solutions from March 2021 are not available.
